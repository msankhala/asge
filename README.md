# Azure Storage GZip Encoding (asge)
.Net Core port of Azure Storage Gzip Encoding project https://github.com/stefangordon/azure-storage-gzip-encoding

The original Azure Storage GZip Encoding project is not cross platform. This project ports into .Net core so that it becomes cross platform and can be run on linux and mac as well.
